# Exercise 1.14
Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the
__count-change__ procedure of section 1.2.2 in making change
for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space
and number of steps used by this process as the amount
to be changed increases?

```
(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 5))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
        (else (+ (cc amount
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                 (cc (- amount
                        (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
                     kinds-of-coins)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
```


And in Haskell:
```
countChange :: Int -> Int
countChange amount = cc amount 5

cc :: Int -> Int -> Int
cc 0 _ = 1
cc _ 0 = 0
cc amount kinds
    | amount < 0 = 0
    | otherwise = ((+) (cc amount (kinds - 1))
                       (cc (amount - firstDenomination kinds) kinds))

firstDenomination :: Int -> Int
firstDenomination k = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50] !! (k - 1)
```

![Exercise14.png](Exercise14.png "the tree illustrating the process (count-change 11)")

The order of growth of the space is __Theta(a + k)__, since
we can process only one tree branch at a time and tree
height is __~a + k__.
As we can see from picture, the order of growth of the time
is __Theta(a^k)__.
Where __a = amount__, __k = kinds-of-coins__ (5 in our example).
